       2. Using smoked ancho/chipotle puree

  Feedback from Champs:
  Wants to see samples on steak cut, and dices like that if the pork. The texture felt tuffer than the previous sample, and he asked if the cook time was the same as previous or shortened? 
  He also wants us to add a combination of liquid smoke and Worcestershire at low levels, or utilize the smoked ancho/chipotle purée used in enchilada revisions (Tony is familiar with the RM). 

  Per Jen: 
  Sample #1:
	  • No seasoning and no Consista, 
	  • Cook: 190F for 4.5 hours.
  Sample #2 (CC-SVB-02)
	  • Conatined 1% Consista, 0.38% House Seasoning.
	  • Cook: 180F for 5 hours.

  Both samples were Inside Round (no roll). What we have seen with adding the 1% Consista, the meat is more tender.
  - Will compare no roll and choice select.

     - 2 Variables
       - No starch
       - 50% starch reduction
*** [2017-05-24 Wed 15:29]
 - (Version1) The starch level is perfect and gives a good moisture level that soaks into the shred. However they want to keep the pork diced and like the size of the dice as well. This gives them versatility with the product.
   - They would like to see a 25% reduction in the Green Chiles, while ensuring onions are maintained at the same as the previous sample.
 - (Version 2) In addition they want to see several samples of the exact formula with the exclusion of all onions and Green Chiles.

*** [2017-05-12 Fri 11:05]

 Feedback from Champs Sample (CC-SVP-05):
 Pork - hold out water in starch mixture and reduce onions and chiles by 20%. Maintain the same seasoning level and move forward with the dice cut.

 Per Jen - We did not add any additional water. All water is from purge and IQF items.

** Sous Vide Chicken
*** [2017-06-15 Thu 16:13] Multi-vac Testing
 - Tested frozen chicken blocks using various sizes Results
 - The 12x14 and 12x16 bags will not work. The 12x18 bag will work but the width may make it difficult to get the chicken in the bag. Also, it may be a bit tight on the length as well.
 - We may need to look at the 14x20 bag. That bag cost is $0.23426/bag. Mitch is looking into this.
 - I tested the Sous Vide rack using empty 14x20 bags to see what will fit. We can get 2 12x18 bags per rack or 4 bags per layer times 2 sides. Here’s what I’m coming up with:
   - 4 bags per layer x 10 layers x 2 sides = 80 5 lb bags per SV rack. That’s 400  lbs of chicken per SV rack.
   - 2 Sv racks in the cooker at a time that’s 800 lbs of chicken cooking at one time @ 2 hours or so cook time.
   - This is a worse case scenario
**** TODO Cutting to evaluate SV Chicken variables.
     SCHEDULED: <2017-06-27 Tue>
     - NOTE [2017-06-20 Tue 15:16] //
       Dan wants to see the following variables
       1. Control
       2. 5 lb block with seasoning dumped in bag (no tumbling) @ current level.
       3. 5 lb block with seasoning dumped in bag (no tumbling) @ double the current level.
       4. All variable as is and with BBQ sauce added.

     - Trying to determine how to properly process the chicken and seasoning.
       1. Option 1 is to process with no seasoning
       2. Option 2 is to process with seasoning dumped in the bag, but not covering the chicken. Prouct and purge are dumped into a bin and partially broken up by hand before repacking.
       3. Option 3 is to process with seasoning dumped in the bag, but not covering the chicken. Product is drained and repacked.
*** [2017-06-07 Wed 10:41]
 - After the cutting, with Dan, yesterday, we preferred the product with the purge to the drained product.
 - With the purge our cost is improved.
 - There was a slight flavor reduction to the BBQ version due to the dilution caused by the purge.
   - We added a slight amount of additional amount of BBQ to bump up flavor.
 - Dan had the idea to use TVP to help bind up excess purge.
   - Make those samples this morning. Results were mixed. added a spongy texture.

 - Queso Mild
   - Reduce cumin by 30%, it was too strong.
   - Increase both the garlic and onion powders to provide a more prominent flavor over the cumin.
   - Take the heat level down by removing both roasted jalapeños and capsicum.
   - Ensure the Chiles do not increase (they’re thinking they will utilize in-house Chiles to increase the heat for a hot version and maintain less SKU’s).
   - Bump up the cheese level to provide a stronger cheese delivery (5% increase), and possibly increase the NFDM to provide a creamier mouthfeel.
   - He’d also like a version using gum as a thickening agent along with the starch. If we use one recommended for dairies it will give a longer mouthfeel.

 - On 5/3/2017 Sent Jeremy Samples of the Leigh Oliver Queso and Comfort Cuisine Hot (Red Lid)
 - Wants to see more green chiles, cumin, onion powder, garlic (powder or minced, be cost efficient), with mild - medium heat. They prefer to use capsicum as a control measure for heat rather than peppers. Also they'd like to add some of the smoked ancho/chipotle purée to a portion (their fear is that it will impact color, use low levels or even liquid smoke)

** Mac and Cheese
*** [2017-05-18 Thu 15:54]
  - Production consistently adds 8 - 11 lbs of additional starch, per batch to meet viscosity spec. Consista starch (100107) was increased by 10 lbs from 49.6 to 59.6 lbs to match production.
  - There was a discrepancy with the water amount. Sauce checklist states to add 20 gallons of water per starch bucket. This is 40 gallons total. This is how the remaining water was calculated on the Sauce Checklist tab. Total water was 1931 lbs (241.4 gallons). 40 gallons would be used for the starch hydration, the remaining 201.4 gallons would be added to the kettle. The cooks; however, were only adding 10 gallons per bucket. 20 gallons for starch hydration and 201.4 gallons added to the kettle. Because of this difference the batch was being shorted by 20 gallons (160 lbs) each time. What the cooks are doing is consistent with the directions on the sauce formula tab. The mistake lies in the Sauce Checklist tab. The remaining water was calculated based on using 40 gallons of water for the starch vs 20 gallons. This has been corrected to match production.
  - I used a water density of 8.34 to convert water to lbs. 221.4 total gallons equals 1846.4 total pounds of water.
  - Sauce Batch size was decreased from 2576.7 lbs to 2502.1 lbs. because of the water difference.
  - Total water was reduced from 1931 lbs to 1846.4 lbs
  - This change will be implemented for 5/23 production.

     Per Jen:
     Summary of Evaluation:
     
     (5-19-17) 17129 Heated sample to 160F. Sample was the sweetest, did not have a cloudy appearance, syrup was shiny.
     (3-11-17) 17070 Heated sample to 160F. Not as sweet, cloudy appearance. Additional sample was boiled for 1 hour and evaluated; visually similar with slightly sweeter taste, cloudy appearance.
     
     After samples were heated there was no visual separation. I did not see it prior to heating.

** Black/Pinto Mix 
*** [2017-06-07 Wed 09:22]
 - Champs will not pursue a pinto/black bean mix. 
*** [2017-05-24 Wed 15:18]
 - Champs has narrowed this down to just the Black and Pinto Mixture. The appearance and texture are spot on. 
 - Champs liked the overall flavor, but want to remove tomatoes and maintain Green Chile level. The bacon fat has to be removed for labeling purposes. The appearance and texture were great, so stick to the same cook time. The slurry was to thin and needs to be thickened with a starch.
 - Jen and Toni made samples today (5/24).
*** DONE Make Pinto/Black Bean mix using IQF beans.
