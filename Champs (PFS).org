     - Champs wants a fully seasoned beef ready to serve.
     - Ideally shredded but they are aware they we do not have the capability to do this prior to be cooked and do not want us to drain it.
     - For now stick to the diced samples.
     - Keep ingredients at their current level, but add a small amount of beef base (Aus Jus base) for an enhanced beef flavor, and some lime to help balance out all the other flavors.
     - Add small amount of Champs seasoning blend (5gr/1lb)
     - No starch.

  Feedback from Champs:
  Wants to see samples on steak cut, and dices like that if the pork. The texture felt tuffer than the previous sample, and he asked if the cook time was the same as previous or shortened? 
  He also wants us to add a combination of liquid smoke and Worcestershire at low levels, or utilize the smoked ancho/chipotle purée used in enchilada revisions (Tony is familiar with the RM). 

  Per Jen: 
  Sample #1:
	  • No seasoning and no Consista, 
	  • Cook: 190F for 4.5 hours.
  Sample #2 (CC-SVB-02)
	  • Conatined 1% Consista, 0.38% House Seasoning.
	  • Cook: 180F for 5 hours.

  Both samples were Inside Round (no roll). What we have seen with adding the 1% Consista, the meat is more tender.
  - Will compare no roll and choice select.

 - Concerns on the coating of starch on the pork in a scaled production form a consistency standpoint.
 - Please try blending the starch with the protein seasoning and see if it will properly disperse.

       - 50% starch reduction
*** [2017-05-24 Wed 15:29]
 - (Version1) The starch level is perfect and gives a good moisture level that soaks into the shred. However they want to keep the pork diced and like the size of the dice as well. This gives them versatility with the product.
   - They would like to see a 25% reduction in the Green Chiles, while ensuring onions are maintained at the same as the previous sample.
 - (Version 2) In addition they want to see several samples of the exact formula with the exclusion of all onions and Green Chiles.

**** DONE [#A] Check on SV Chicken cook/chill validation
     CLOSED: [2017-07-19 Wed 12:17] DEADLINE: <2017-07-19 Wed>
     - NOTE [2017-07-19 Wed 12:10] \\
     - Two runs with data loggers on 7/18. One probe was in the chicken, the other probe was in the water.
     - Product temp was <40 after 2.5 hours in the chiller.
     - Water temp, generally speaking, is within a couple of degrees of the product temp.
     - Both data loggers were kept in the chicken over night.  One was in the cage in the cooler and one was left in the chiller, both show that we are able to keep the temperature below 40°F in both situations.
     
- Need to validate our cook/chill process of the Sous Vide chicken to verify the maximum amount of time it takes the product to reach the CCP, and chill back down below 40F.
- In many cases there is a cook cycle that comes out at the end of the shift that will be left in the chiller overnight. This causes us to have incomplete documentation of the process.
- The data loggers need to be utilized as a verification/validation tool of this process. In order to so the chicken will have to be thawed, than refroze, and complete the entire cook/chill process.
  - This will need to be done on multiple production dates. I also suggest only using one probe for the chicken, while utilizing the second probe to monitor the water temperature of each throughout the entire process.
*** [2017-06-22 Thu 13:51] Tasting SV Chicken with Dan
 - Dan preferred the variable with the current amount of house seasoning just dumped into the bag, no tumbling required.
 - We will move forward with processing chicken without tempering it.
   - We will transfer chicken straight from vendor pack to a either a 12x18 or 12x20 multivac pouch.

*** [2017-06-15 Thu 16:13] Multi-vac Testing
 - Tested frozen chicken blocks using various sizes Results
 - The 12x14 and 12x16 bags will not work. The 12x18 bag will work but the width may make it difficult to get the chicken in the bag. Also, it may be a bit tight on the length as well.
 - We may need to look at the 14x20 bag. That bag cost is $0.23426/bag. Mitch is looking into this.
 - I tested the Sous Vide rack using empty 14x20 bags to see what will fit. We can get 2 12x18 bags per rack or 4 bags per layer times 2 sides. Here’s what I’m coming up with:
   - 4 bags per layer x 10 layers x 2 sides = 80 5 lb bags per SV rack. That’s 400  lbs of chicken per SV rack.
   - 2 Sv racks in the cooker at a time that’s 800 lbs of chicken cooking at one time @ 2 hours or so cook time.
   - This is a worse case scenario
**** DONE Cutting to evaluate SV Chicken variables.

     - NOTE [2017-06-20 Tue 15:16] //
       Dan wants to see the following variables
       1. Control
       2. 5 lb block with seasoning dumped in bag (no tumbling) @ current level.
       3. 5 lb block with seasoning dumped in bag (no tumbling) @ double the current level.
       4. All variable as is and with BBQ sauce added.

     - Trying to determine how to properly process the chicken and seasoning.
       1. Option 1 is to process with no seasoning
       2. Option 2 is to process with seasoning dumped in the bag, but not covering the chicken. Prouct and purge are dumped into a bin and partially broken up by hand before repacking.
       3. Option 3 is to process with seasoning dumped in the bag, but not covering the chicken. Product is drained and repacked.
*** [2017-06-07 Wed 10:41]
 - After the cutting, with Dan, yesterday, we preferred the product with the purge to the drained product.
 - With the purge our cost is improved.
 - There was a slight flavor reduction to the BBQ version due to the dilution caused by the purge.
   - We added a slight amount of additional amount of BBQ to bump up flavor.
 - Dan had the idea to use TVP to help bind up excess purge.
   - Make those samples this morning. Results were mixed. added a spongy texture.

 - This item will not be drained and also must be ready to serve.
 - The initial direction is to keep the house seasoning at the same level as the current product; however we will need to add a small amount of IQF cilantro and some lime.
 - No protein seasoning at this point.

***** Queso
  - [2017-07-05 Wed 16:19] Lab tasting with Jeremy
    - Needs additional salt
    - Needs more cheese flavor. Most likely use club cheddar. We can use colored or uncolored depending on usage level. We don't want to impart too much color.
    - Could use Blue Cheese flavor as well.
    - More Green chiles
    - More starch
  - Champs prefer Version CC-MWQ-06 that has the pepper jack cheese in the product.
  - The preference is to be slightly thicker and a 5-10% increase in Green Chiles.
  - Champs is still seeking to get more of a cheese delivery (flavor) from this.
    - Jeremy's initial suggestion is to increase in salt to possibly bring the cheese flavor out more, but then mentioned cheese flavoring etc.
    - In the past we have utilized the Club Cheddar to provide this additional flavor.
  - If we have some retention bags available than lets heat a portion of it, and add salt to some and the uncolored cheddar to the other portion.
    - We can sample these to see if it adds value.

 - Queso Mild
   - Reduce cumin by 30%, it was too strong.
   - Increase both the garlic and onion powders to provide a more prominent flavor over the cumin.
   - Take the heat level down by removing both roasted jalapeños and capsicum.
   - Ensure the Chiles do not increase (they’re thinking they will utilize in-house Chiles to increase the heat for a hot version and maintain less SKU’s).
   - Bump up the cheese level to provide a stronger cheese delivery (5% increase), and possibly increase the NFDM to provide a creamier mouthfeel.
   - He’d also like a version using gum as a thickening agent along with the starch. If we use one recommended for dairies it will give a longer mouthfeel.

   - Increase both the garlic and onion powders to provide a more prominent flavor over the cumin.
   - Take the heat level down by removing both roasted jalapeños and capsicum.
   - Ensure the Chiles do not increase (they’re thinking they will utilize in-house Chiles to increase the heat for a hot version and maintain less SKU’s).
   - Bump up the cheese level to provide a stronger cheese delivery (5% increase), and possibly increase the NFDM to provide a creamier mouthfeel.

   - He’d also like a version using gum as a thickening agent along with the starch. If we use one recommended for dairies it will give a longer mouthfeel.

 - On 5/3/2017 Sent Jeremy Samples of the Leigh Oliver Queso and Comfort Cuisine Hot (Red Lid)
 - Wants to see more green chiles, cumin, onion powder, garlic (powder or minced, be cost efficient), with mild - medium heat. They prefer to use capsicum as a control measure for heat rather than peppers. Also they'd like to add some of the smoked ancho/chipotle purée to a portion (their fear is that it will impact color, use low levels or even liquid smoke)

     - Comments based on sample # JAF-CBB-11A
     - Still too thick with not enough moisture.
     - The starch appears to be giving the slurry an off-color white appearance. Champs would like to avoid this if at all possible.
     - The suggestion is try a gum in place of a starch to provide less of the off color. With more moisture means we will need more seasoning.
       - The gum did not fare well either. too thick and still same off color.
     - Considering this item is kettle cooked I’d like to have all ingredients over at Harding on Wednesday so we can make a sample batch while he is here.

  - Production consistently adds 8 - 11 lbs of additional starch, per batch to meet viscosity spec. Consista starch (100107) was increased by 10 lbs from 49.6 to 59.6 lbs to match production.
  - There was a discrepancy with the water amount. Sauce checklist states to add 20 gallons of water per starch bucket. This is 40 gallons total. This is how the remaining water was calculated on the Sauce Checklist tab. Total water was 1931 lbs (241.4 gallons). 40 gallons would be used for the starch hydration, the remaining 201.4 gallons would be added to the kettle. The cooks; however, were only adding 10 gallons per bucket. 20 gallons for starch hydration and 201.4 gallons added to the kettle. Because of this difference the batch was being shorted by 20 gallons (160 lbs) each time. What the cooks are doing is consistent with the directions on the sauce formula tab. The mistake lies in the Sauce Checklist tab. The remaining water was calculated based on using 40 gallons of water for the starch vs 20 gallons. This has been corrected to match production.
  - I used a water density of 8.34 to convert water to lbs. 221.4 total gallons equals 1846.4 total pounds of water.
  - Sauce Batch size was decreased from 2576.7 lbs to 2502.1 lbs. because of the water difference.
  - Total water was reduced from 1931 lbs to 1846.4 lbs
  - This change will be implemented for 5/23 production.

** Black/Pinto Mix 
*** [2017-06-07 Wed 09:22]
 - Champs will not pursue a pinto/black bean mix. 
*** [2017-05-24 Wed 15:18]
 - Champs has narrowed this down to just the Black and Pinto Mixture. The appearance and texture are spot on. 
 - Champs liked the overall flavor, but want to remove tomatoes and maintain Green Chile level. The bacon fat has to be removed for labeling purposes. The appearance and texture were great, so stick to the same cook time. The slurry was to thin and needs to be thickened with a starch.
 - Jen and Toni made samples today (5/24).
