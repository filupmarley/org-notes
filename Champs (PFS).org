** Sous Vide Beef
 [2017-05-12 Fri 11:03]

 Feedback from Champs:
 Wants to see samples on steak cut, and dices like that if the pork. The texture felt tuffer than the previous sample, and he asked if the cook time was the same as previous or shortened? 
 He also wants us to add a combination of liquid smoke and Worcestershire at low levels, or utilize the smoked ancho/chipotle purée used in enchilada revisions (Tony is familiar with the RM). 

 Per Jen: 
 Sample #1:
	 • No seasoning and no Consista, 
	 • Cook: 190F for 4.5 hours.
 Sample #2 (CC-SVB-02)
	 • Conatined 1% Consista, 0.38% House Seasoning.
	 • Cook: 180F for 5 hours.

 Both samples were Inside Round (no roll). What we have seen with adding the 1% Consista, the meat is more tender.
 - Will compare no roll and choice select.

** Sous Vide Pork
[2017-05-12 Fri 11:05]

Feedback from Champs Sample (CC-SVP-05):
Pork - hold out water in starch mixture and reduce onions and chiles by 20%. Maintain the same seasoning level and move forward with the dice cut.

Per Jen - We did not add any additional water. All water is from purge and IQF items.

** Queso
[2017-05-12 Fri 11:07]
 - On 5/3/2017 Sent Jeremy Samples of the Leigh Oliver Queso and Comfort Cuisine Hot (Red Lid)
 - Wants to see more green chiles, cumin, onion powder, garlic (powder or minced, be cost efficient), with mild - medium heat. They prefer to use capsicum as a control measure for heat rather than peppers. Also they'd like to add some of the smoked ancho/chipotle purée to a portion (their fear is that it will impact color, use low levels or even liquid smoke)

      Hanover IQF bean costs:
      50# IQF Black Beans are $38.00  FOB = .76 fob + .072 freight = $.832 del cost
      50# IQF Pinto Beans are $37.00 FOB = .74 fob + .072 freight = $.812 del cost
      
      1# Tote IQF Black Beans are .65/lb FOB + .072 freight = $.722 del cost
      1# Tote IQF Pinto Beans are .62/lb FOB + .072 freight =  $.692 del cost
      
      Other IQF bean samples from Norpac arrived there last week.
      Norpac IQF Beans Costs:
      IQF Pinto Beans – totes –  .65 fob Oregon + .11 freight = $.76 delivered cost
      IQF Black beans – totes -  .68 fob Oregon + .11 freight = $.79 delivered cost
      
      
      Current delivered costs on Hanover canned beans – 
      Pintos – .4686 lb. del.
      Black beans - .511 lb. del.
      
      Del Monte/Allens also has #10 canned pintos and black beans.
      I have samples of both here at Harding.
      Their pricing is cheaper than Hanover.
      Pintos - .4084 lb delivered
      Black Beans - .4444 delivered
      
      If we choose not to go with the IQF beans, the Delmonte/Allen product might be a cheaper option for canned beans.
