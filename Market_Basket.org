 - Our sample was thicker than control. Could be something with the freeze/thaw process. Whiter than control as well. Less parm flavor.
   1. Will reduce starch amount. Will target a slightly thinner sauce prior to freezing.
   2. Reduce Titanium Dioxide
   3. Increase parm through either parm cheese or parm base.

 - There appeared to be a great deal more tomatoes in our sample veresus control. The amount was actually not changed so we need to look at what the difference might be.

       Went well. Overall feeling was the reformulated items are good, but need more work on consistency and flavor impact.
