First production of SS Pizza Sauce. Produced 2 batches @2500 lbs each.
 - No major issues
 - Product tasted great.
 - No issues during batching.
 - No issues during Cryovac filling.
 - Call outs
   - Tomato skins collecting on the rotosolver mix head.
     - May need to add an in-line filter to catch these skins.
   - The rotosolver mix time of 10 minutes may have been too long.
     - The production product was smoother than lab product. This may not be an issue, but we may need to adjust this procedure.
