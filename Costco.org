 - Looking to increase the current shelf life of the veggie and dressing blend to 53 days various reasons such as, production scheduling, logistics, RM ordering and usage, etc.
 - Before we approach Costco for approval we need very detailed results of both organoleptic and micro data.

** TODO Need to perform sensory analysis of veggie and dressing blend for day 53.
