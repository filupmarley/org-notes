**** TODO Process Pork butt whole in SV bag for Jafco             :Benchwork:
     SCHEDULED: <2017-08-04 Fri>
- Same exact product, whole, not chunked. Do they have the capability to cook an entire skinless picnic or Boston butt in the sous vide bag?
- Same recipe, everything - customer just wants the option to cut/chop/pull it at the unit level now.
